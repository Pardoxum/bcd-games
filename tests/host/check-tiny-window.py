"""[win-create] / [tiny-win] and env.MADEIRA_TINY_WINDOW_FIX (build 578); no Wine runs.

American Truck Simulator (Steam 270880, iPad16,10, build 576) opens as a 132x38 window -- Wine's minimum
window size -- whose swapchain draws 1024x768, and nothing ever sizes it. build/win32u-unix/driver_ios.c
now logs what each top-level window was asked for ([win-create]) and, for a swapchain window that stays
under 160x120 while a 320x200 or larger picture is drawn into it for 3 s, says so ([tiny-win]); with
env.MADEIRA_TINY_WINDOW_FIX = 1 it also sizes that window to the virtual screen (twice at most).

Checks: the production decision region (tiny-test) compiled and run on the host (the thresholds, the
switch: exactly "1"); the wiring in driver_ios.c (the poll runs from pProcessEvents, the create wrapper is
registered, nothing is resized unless the switch is on, at most two tries, 3 s of persistence, the screen
must be at least 320x200); Winios.m's side (the slot table, the drawable written by the Metal layer, reset
when a slot is taken); the key in the catalog, the download policy, the session cleanup and Truck
Simulator's list line (minBuild 578).
