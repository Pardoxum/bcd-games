"""env.DOTNET_GCRegionRange for a .NET 7+ game whose garbage collector cannot reserve 256 GB; no Wine runs.

Unrailed! 2: Back on Track (Steam 2211170, build 576, tester log CR8H6H) starts a .NET 7+ runtime (Godot's
Bootstrap.exe) that stops at once: "GC heap initialization failed with error 0x8007000E" (E_OUTOFMEMORY) and
"Failed to create CoreCLR". The regions-based GC reserves a range of virtual memory when it starts, 256 GB by
default; the log's request is 0x3fd2d28000 (261421 MB), and BCD's address map has no such gap ("[mmap-place]
ml1027 NO GAP FITS ... largest gap 32768 MB", "[jumbo] kernel-pick reserve failed (0xc0000017)"). Microsoft
documents DOTNET_GCRegionRange (hexadecimal bytes, .NET 7 and later) for exactly this E_OUTOFMEMORY and
advises two to five times the committed heap, or twice the physical memory the process has when that is
unknown; BCD reports at most 8 GB, so 16 GB = 400000000, which fits the 32 GB gap. Nothing in the app reads
the name; this check holds the wiring together:

  - auto-tune's rule "dotnet-gc-region-range" adds the line after that error, at once (no unchanged retry),
    and not again when the session already ran with it;
  - a fixture from the tester's log proves the rule, and the value is the documented one that fits the gap
    the log reports;
  - the settings catalog documents the name (build/tools/gen-config-catalog.py OVERLAY);
  - a downloaded list may set it, as a hexadecimal size from 1 GB to 64 GB, and only builds from 579 get the
    line (older builds' policy does not know the name: a download naming it would be refused whole);
  - Unrailed 2's list (Steam 2211170) carries it.
